            <p>My name is Steve Stackle. I am a web designer and developer living in northern Westchester County, New York City’s back yard. I build good-looking and responsive websites at affordable prices for individuals and small companies. I provide clean, functional web design that allows for easy client content management. I can take your website from start to finish or freshen up an existing website. I can meet you in Westchester or the New York metropolitan area when in-person meetings happen again.</p>
            <p>When you hire Stackle Box Design, you will work with me personally. I will design and develop a website customized to your needs.</p>
            <p>I grew up in southern Wisconsin and attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I studied theatrical design and production. In the early 1990’s, I moved to New York and worked in theatrical production until the pandemic shut down Broadway.</p>
            <p>I also design and build websites. I first got interested in web design in the early 2000’s and took classes in HTML, web page development, and Adobe Flash at New York University’s School of Continuing and Professional Studies and the New School in NYC. I have attended numerous design seminars, primarily focused on the use of Adobe products, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash.</p>
            <p>In the late Aughts, I discovered WordPress. I started using it for my own websites then for my clients as well. It provides a great way to develop a good-looking site that an end user can easily keep up to date.</p>
            <p>More recently I studyied the underlying technologies of WordPress, including the PHP programming language and the latest CSS for styling. I can make you a custom WordPress theme as well as develop custom WordPress plug-ins if needed. In addition to building websites, I have started developing Android apps.</p>
            <p>Currently I am enrolled in the Information and Communications Technology master's degree program at the University of Denver, specializing in software design and programming. I am scheduled to receive my degree in the spring of 2021.</p>
